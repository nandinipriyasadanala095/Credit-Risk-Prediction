# Credit Risk Prediction with LightGBM, Hyperopt and SHAP

## Project Overview

### Business Context
Credit risk refers to the potential loss a lender may face when a borrower fails to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. The goal of a credit risk assessment is to determine if potential borrowers are creditworthy, have the means to repay their debts, and to minimize credit risk. This project involves building a classification model for default prediction using LightGBM, optimizing hyperparameters with Hyperopt, and using SHAP for model explainability.

### Aim
The aim of this project is to predict loan defaulters and reduce the risk of financial loss by analyzing credit history, employment, and demographic data.

---

### Data Description
The dataset includes information on 143,727 borrowers, including attributes such as employment type, work experience, income, dependents, total loans, and total payments.

---

### Tech Stack
- Language: `Python`
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `lightgbm`, `hyperopt`, `shap`

## Approach

1. **Data Reading**
2. **Data Processing**
    - Drop Columns
    - Split Data
    - Define Label
    - Roll Rate Analysis
    - Window Roll Analysis
3. **Feature Engineering**
    - Label
    - % Amount Paid as interest in past Loan Repayment
    - % of Loans defaulted in the last 2 years
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Univariate Analysis
        - Numerical Summary: Min, Max, Mean, Median, etc.
        - Categorical Summary: Top, Unique, Count, etc.
    - Bivariate Analysis
        - Correlation Plot
        - Box Plots
5. **Target Encoding**
6. **Feature Selection**
    - Random Forest
    - Decision Tree
7. **ML Model Development**
    - LightGBM
    - Hyperparameter Tuning using Hyperopt
8. **Model Evaluation**
    - ROC AUC
    - PRAUC
    - Score Distribution
9. **Feature Importance**
    - Split and Gain
    - SHAP
10. **Class Rate Curve and Right Threshold**

## Modular Code Overview

1. `input`: Contains the raw data for analysis, in this case, `credit_risk_data.csv`.
2. `documents`: Contains supporting learning material.
3. `lib`: A reference folder containing the original iPython notebook used in lectures.
4. `ml_pipeline`: Contains functions in various Python files for processing the data and training the model.
5. `output`: The folder where the trained model is saved.
6. `engine.py`: A script that calls the functions in the `ml_pipeline` to run the entire process and save the model.
7. `requirements.txt`: Lists required libraries and versions.
8. `readme.md`: Instructions for running the code.
